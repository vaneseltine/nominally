    abstract={The IRIS UMETRICS 2020 Data Release linkage files include crosswalks between IRIS data and external datasets (e.g., federal award and publication data) at the award level. The improved award match rate (in both NSF and NIH award linkage) reflects our continuous effort to minimize false positives and false negatives. As indicated above, we expanded award linkage from award to individual level this year by linking UMETRICS employee name and NSF / NIH Primary Investigator (PI) names. Based on individual name matching, we developed two team-focused data files that can be useful in addressing research questions concerning team characteristics (such as diversity) and their impact on research performance and productivity if team files are linked to Core files.},
