# Name pieces that appear before a last name. Prefixes join to the piece
# that follows them to make one new piece. They can be chained together, e.g
# "von der" and "de la". Because they only appear in middle or last names,
# they also signifiy that all following name pieces should be in the same name
# part, for example, "von" will be joined to all following pieces that are not
# prefixes or suffixes, allowing recognition of double last names when they
# appear after a prefixes. So in "pennie von bergen wessels MD", "von" will
# join with all following name pieces until the suffix "MD", resulting in the
# correct parsing of the last name "von bergen wessels".
