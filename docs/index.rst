Nominally
================================

*Nominally* simplifies and parses a personal name written in
`Western name order <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name#Name_order>`_
into six core fields: title, first, middle, last, suffix, and nickname.

Typically, *nominally* is used to parse entire lists or
`pd.Series <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html>`_
of names en masse. This package includes a command line tool
to parse a single name for convenient one-off testing and examples.


For Record Linkage
--------------------------

*Nominally* is designed to assist at the front end of record linkage, during
data preprocessing.

Varying quality and practices across institutions and datasets introduce noise
into data and cause misrepresentation. This increases the challenges of
deduplicating rows within data and and linking names across multiple datasets.
We observe this by-no-means-exhaustive list:

    - First and middle names split arbitrarily.
    - Misplaced prefixes of last names (e.g., "van" and "de la").
    - Records with multiple last names partitioned into middle name fields.
    - Titles and suffixes various recorded in fields and/or with separators.
    - Inconsistent capture of accents and other non-ASCII characters.
    - Single name fields concatenating name parts arbitrarily.


In attempting to match someone named Ramsay Jackson Canning across data,
one may uncover

    - R.J. CANNING JUNIOR
    - Canning, Ramsay J.
    - Ramsay "R.J." Jackson Canning
    - Dr. Ramsay Jackson Canning, M.D.
    - Ramsay J. Canning, Jr.
    - canning, jr., dr. ramsay

â€”and so on.

*Nominally* can't fix *all* of your data problems (sorry).

But it can help by **consistently extracting the most useful features of
personal names** under the highly restrictive case of a single string name
field. *Nominally* :ref:`aggressively cleans <cleaning>`, scrapes titles,
nicknames, and suffixes, and parses apart first, middle, and last names.
In the list above (and many, many variations beyond), *nominally* correctly
captures each Canning as a last name, each R(amsay) as a first, both types
of suffix, and so forth.
